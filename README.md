# Trader_Bot_Fun
This is a fun project idea that I wanted to just do for some fun. I was hoping that maybe I could import company financials to this repo, and then maybe determine an algorithm
to see if the stock would be worth buying, giving it a score from either an A+ to an F. I dont imagine the bot could make real time trades, as that is way too complicated,
and involves connecting it to a brokerage account, which would be near impossible to do, but maybe anaylze quarterly statements, and current statistics on a price.

Here below I listed the 9 things that you should take into account when buying a stock, and I added little notes to describe what each of them means, I then listed how easy or hard
I think they would be to incorporate them into an algorithm

1. Price- The first and most obvious thing to look at with a stock is the price. How much will it cost to buy a share of this company?

2. Revenue Growth- Revenue is often referred to as the "top line," and it's a major indicator of whether a company has been successful.

3. Earnings Per Share- if a company made $40 million in profits last year and has 24 million shares, the EPS is $1.66.

4. Dividend and Dividend Yield-Many companies will return a portion of their earnings to shareholders. 
Investors can get a small payment for every share they own, known as a dividend.

5. Market Capitalization- A company's market cap is essentially the value of all its shares.

6. Historical Prices- Looking at five-year, 10-year, and even 15-year returns will give you a sense of whether a company can withstand tough stretches.
Historical returns are not a guarantee of future performance, but can at minimum be illustrative.

8. The Industry- It's usually important to examine not just a stock, but the industry that the company operates in.

9. Major Economic Indicators- No matter how hard it tries, a company can't control every single thing that might impact business.

The broader economy of the nation and the world can play an outsized role in the health of a company and its share performance.
I also took into account that some of these things would be easier to incorporate than others, but heres what I think will be the easiest and hardest to take into account

Price EASY, look at how close or far it is from its 52 week high or low

Revenue Growth EASY, pretty self explanatory
Earnings per Share EASY just a number that you can look at, if its negative its bad, if its positive it is good

Dividend and dividend yield EASY, just a number, and the bigger it is the better it is

Market Capitalization HARD- Hard to really tell with this because a big company doesnt mean it is profitable

Historical Prices HARD a company 10 years ago would be a lot different than now and isn't always a good economic indicator

The Industry HARD, business models vary widely by company by debt level and profit margins :(

 Major Economic Indicators HARD, I'm not an economist, and it is not the easiest thing in the world to explain to a computer a Financial recession :(
 
 This is kind of just a fun project I want to work on, and I think it would be fun to work on, and maybe see if we could come up with something cool. I think a difficult part
 of this puzzle though is that we have to figure out the best way to feed it data is, and also how to update it in an efficient and easy way. I don't really have a deadline for
 this, but I think I would like to have something cool, maybe like something cool before the end of this year.
